                    Muhammad Roman Sajid was a brave soul who stood for the
                    cause with unwavering courage. On May 20th, 2024, at 3:00
                    AM, during a peaceful protest at D-Chowk, Islamabad, he,
                    along with another protestor, was murdered in cold blood
                    when a car ruthlessly and intentionally ran over the
                    protesters. His life was taken while he was peacefully
                    standing for the rights of Gaza. His sacrifice has become a
                    beacon of hope, a symbol of unwavering dedication, and a
                    powerful call for justice.
